[Update: Instagram broke my project.](https://www.instagram.com/developer/platform_update/)

The June 1, 2016 change to the Instagram api gets rid of the client_id method of authentication. Beyond that, the OAuth authentication is subject to an approval process, else it operates in sandbox mode, limited to the media results of up to 5 approved sandbox users. Unfortunately, according to the Instagram Permissions Review form, this type of project does not conform to the accepted use cases for approval. It was a wild ride.
